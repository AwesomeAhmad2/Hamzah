									<h3>Alliance Francaise:</h3>
									<h3>Creativity</h3>
									<p><u>Tuesday, September 11, 2018</u></p>
									<p>Over the summer, I registered in a French course at Alliance Francaise in the Diplomatic Quarter. I would go there to acquire knowledge in the French language and meet other peeople who have different goals than me. One of the reasons I wanted to learn a new language is because I believe in Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis. The hypothesis states that different languages create different ways of thinking. However, there were other reasons why I wanted to learn French. </p>
									<p>From this experience, I gained many IB learner profiles. The most notable one was communicator, for the reason that I gained relationships with my classmates and learned the language by communicating in class. After the 7 week course, I felt my perspective of the world changed, which indicates that Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is correct. Aside from the language itself, I learned about the French culture and how they live their daily lives.</p>

									<h3>Saudi National Day:</h3>
									<h3>Service</h3>
									<p><u>Thursday, September 27, 2018</u></p>
									<p>Today, we celebrated the 88th Saudi National day in school. As part of the celebration, our superintendent invited students from another school that were suffering from down-syndrome. I volunteered to aid in greeting, welcoming, and making sure the down-syndrome students did what they were supposed to do. When they arrived, I tried to greet them with a big smile and kind words. Then, we helped them sit down in their authorized seats. </p>
									<p>After my interactions with the children, I realized the blessing I was in as I began to reflect on the experience. I felt somewhat guilty because they did nothing to wrong to get diseased and I did nothing to deserve to not get diseased. Another learner profile I used was caring. Whenever I interacted with them, I tried to show how much I care about them. A specific incident I remember would be when I saw one of the students who appeared to be lost, so I helped him find his friends.</p>

									<h3>Driving Lessons:</h3>
									<h3>Creativity</h3>
									<p><u>Saturday, October 28, 2018</u></p>
									<p>Yesterday, my older brother took me out to teach me how to drive. After lunch, he took me to an area where we can train easily and we started training. We picked an empty parking to cones because it is ideal for driving training. He would show me things to do, then I would try to replicate it. We worked on turning, parking, and awareness of your surroundings. Also, we worked on getting used to the car and its dimensions and how to deal with certain situations.</p>
									<p>This isn't the first time nor last time I perform this activity, which allowed to demonstrate and develop in many IB learner profiles. However, I believe I displayed other important skills. First of all, I dislplayed my patience while drving; not only in the act itself, but in understanding that learning how to drive is going to take time. I believe the IB learner profile I demonstarted the most was priincipled, which correlates to being patient. I showed my ability to control a car while being displined and understanding the danger of this activity.</p>

									<h3>A Walk in the Park:</h3>
									<h3>Creativity</h3>
									<p><u>Monday, November 12, 2018</u></p>
									<p>This week in school, our language and literature A teacher decided to take our lesson for the day to a nearby park. Me along with the teacher and the other students headed out to the park in the beginning of class taking only our books, which we are reading in class and is called "1984 by George Orwell". On our way to the park, my classmate Nawaf gave us a fast summary about the events that happened in Chapter 5. Then, when we arrived at the park we all split up and read Chapter 6 in the peace of the park.</p>
									<p>After returning back to school, I decided to write a CAS reflection on this experience. I believe that some this experience I gained values that weren't present in me before. For example, I never realized how satisfying it is to interact with nature and how peaceful it is to read a book while hearing the chirping of the birds. I displayed a very important IB learner profile, which was being openminded about the creation of nature. In my opinion, we, as a commnuity, should contemplate the beautiful nature around us.</p>

									<h3>Trip to Al-Baha</h3>
									<h3>Creativity</h3>
									<p><u>Sunday, November 18, 2018</u><p>
									<p>Last weekend, my older brothers and I traveled to Al-Baha to attend our friend's wedding. We arrived Friday afternoon and as soon as we landed at the airport, we realized the beauty of nature in Al-Baha. As we drove to the hotel, I continued to admire the beauty of the Hejaz Mountains as well as take a couple of pictures here and there. In the evening, we drove to the wedding. As soon as we arrived, we understood the difference of traditions in Al-Baha and other regions in the Kingdom. The next day we visited toursit attractions such as Dhey Al Ain Village and Al Raghdan Forest Park.</p>
									       <div class="image filtered tinted" data-position="center">
                                <img src="images/IMG_0689.jpg" alt="" style="width:499px;height:499px;"/>
                            </div>
									<div class="image filtered tinted" data-position="center">
                                <img src="images/IMG_0682.jpg" alt="" style="width:499px;height:499px;"/>
                            </div>
									<p>While reflecting on the trip, i realized that this experience changed me as a person. First of all, I displayed and developed many of my IB learner profiles. I was openminded during the wedding towards the traditions of the people of Al-Baha. Also, I was reflective about how God was able to create such beautiful mountains and how nature works; from the trees to the mountains to the bees. Finally, I was principled because I visited public property that cannot be fixed if it were to be damaged.</p>
