									<h3>Creativity</h3>
									<p><u>Tuesday, September 11, 2018</u></p>
									<p>Over the summer, i registered in a French course at Alliance Francaise in the Diplomatic Quarter. I would go there to acquire knowledge in the French language and meet other peeople who have different goals than me. One of the reasons i wanted to learn a new language is because i believe in Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis. The hypothesis states that different languages create different ways of thinking. However, there were other reasons why i wanted to learn French. </p>
									<p>From this experience, i gained many IB learner profiles. The most notable one was communicator, for the reason that i gained relationships with my classmates and learned the language by communicating in class. After the 7 week course, i felt my perspective of the world changed, which indicates that Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is correct. Aside from the language itself, i learned about the French culture and how they live their daily lives.</p>

									<h3>Service</h3>
									<p>Thursday, September 27, 2018</p>
									<p>Today, we celebrated the 88th Saudi National day in school. As part of the celebration, our superintendent invited students from another school that were suffering from down-syndrome. I volunteered to aid in greeting, welcoming, and making sure the down-syndrome students did what they were supposed to do. When they arrived, i tried to greet them with a big smile and kind words. Then, we helped them sit down in their authorized seats. </p>
									<p>After my interactions with the children, i realized the blessing i was in as i began to reflect on the experience. I felt somewhat guilty because they did nothing to wrong to get diseased and i did nothing to deserve to not get diseased. Another learner profile i used was caring. Whenever i interacted with them, i tried to show how much i care about them. A specific incident i remember would be when i saw one of the students who appeared to be lost, so i helped him find his friends.</p>
